collects the required files for engineering a job at one place.

This project was designed and programmed while I was working with ESC Automation.

During my work, I had to look at multiple files in order to get a clear picture about what is required for the job.

Unfortunately, switching between files and jobs took a long time because jobs were organized in alphanumeric order and not based on engineer's profile.

So I designed the GUI that you can see and used it to store all needed files of a job in one place, and all jobs in one dropdown list.
